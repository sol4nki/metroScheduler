# day 1 (mon nov 17)

no idea, so working with banners as its the simplest and thinking of ideas 
1. idea - adding graph to display metro properly (like use game logic refresh using os the terminal and display metro graph and active also switched similarly)
2. using ANSI Shadow font for delhi metro text and making it look india themed too haha using color codes so like it looks like the flag -> https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=ANSI%20Shadow&t=Delhi%20METRO&x=none website used 
3. figured out the biggest headache, how to work with terminal uis so -> ill be using an amazing inbuilt module named shutil :D


Updates -> loading works finally centered shadow wasnt working so i removed the shadow, banner looks nice indian flag and colorful
also added clock for the main graph display ill have it right at the top in the middle like loading screen :DD

Plans -> keep ascii look, make graph functional its just an idea rn sketched out, time on top && graph ui design in figma
