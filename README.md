# metroScheduler
Task is to simulate the Delhi Metro Scheduler - [IP]



1. Data Collection (Mandatory Before Coding)
    Collect complete station lists for the Blue Line and Magenta Line of Delhi Metro.
    Collect approximate travel times between consecutive stations.
    Save this data in text format.
2. Phase 1 – File Handling & Data Loading
    Practice saving and reading data using only basic file operations (write(), read(), split())
    Load your collected metro data into Python using these techniques.
3. Phase 2 – Core Functionalities
    You will implement two main features:
    A. Metro Timings Calculator
    Using your travel-time data, compute and display:
    When the next train will arrive at any station
    The arrival times of trains moving in both directions
    B. Ride Journey Planner
    Given a source and destination station:
    Find the best route
    Show total travel time
    Identify interchange stations (if any)
    Show when the rider can catch the next train from the starting station
4. Code Requirements
    You are not allowed to use: pickle, pandas, or external libraries.
    You may use only:
    Basic file operations (open, read, write, close)
    Basic Python features: loops, lists, dicts, string manipulation
5. Deliverables:
    The meta data stored in text format, metro_data.txt
    Your python source code: metro_simulator.py
    A detailed readme file.
